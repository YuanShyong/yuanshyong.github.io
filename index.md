## About Me

My family name is Ooi, and Yuan Shyong is my given name. Born and raised in Malaysia, I've embarked on an academic journey that has taken me from the University of Science, Malaysia to the esteemed halls of National Taiwan University, where I've completed both my M.Sc. and Ph.D. under the guidance of my advisor [Yng-Ing Lee](https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=39253). My drive for unveiling mathematical truths within Differential Geometry especially in minimal subamanifold theory spurs my daily endeavors in both teaching and research.

I embraced the post of Postdoctoral Fellow at National Taiwan University from October 2020 to July 2021. From August 2021 to Feb 2024, I have been dedicated to my research as a Postdoctoral Fellow at Pusan National University within the Basic Research Laboratory [BRL](https://sites.google.com/view/geometrybrl/people?authuser=0), under my host [Juncheol Pyo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RrX0fsEAAAAJ&hl=ko) where my work continues to push the boundaries of geometric analysis. Currently I am doing my postdoc at National Center for Theoretical Science [NCTS](https://ncts.ntu.edu.tw/). 


## Research Interests

I delve into the intriguing world of Differential Geometry and focus on:

- Higher codimension minimal submanifold problems â€” considering Bernstein-type problems and graphical minimal submanifolds including stability, uniqueness, existence, and regularity issues.
- Examining self-similar solutions of mean curvature flow, and the rigidity and classification of mean curvature flow soliton solutions.
